## Seperating Arrays


```python
import numpy as np

x = np.random.randint(0, 100, 30)
np.split(x, [10, 20])
```




    [array([68,  6, 65, 25, 88, 65, 69, 65, 45, 44]),
     array([ 3, 59,  7, 96, 67, 39, 38, 36, 79, 70]),
     array([79, 72, 91, 10, 81, 63, 40, 77, 88, 73])]




```python
y = np.arange(16).reshape(4, 4)
np.vsplit(y, [2])
```




    [array([[0, 1, 2, 3],
            [4, 5, 6, 7]]), array([[ 8,  9, 10, 11],
            [12, 13, 14, 15]])]




```python
np.hsplit(y, [2])
```




    [array([[ 0,  1],
            [ 4,  5],
            [ 8,  9],
            [12, 13]]), array([[ 2,  3],
            [ 6,  7],
            [10, 11],
            [14, 15]])]



### EXAMPLE


```python
a, b = np.vsplit(y, [2])
np.hstack([a, b])
```




    array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3,  8,  9, 10, 11],
           [ 4,  5,  6,  7, 12, 13, 14, 15]])



### SORTING ARRAYS


```python
x = np.random.randint(10, 50, 30)
x
```




    array([18, 27, 18, 38, 43, 40, 40, 40, 18, 11, 44, 13, 45, 46, 16, 35, 40,
           34, 24, 33, 13, 24, 30, 24, 33, 21, 25, 34, 22, 18])




```python
np.sort(x)
```




    array([11, 13, 13, 16, 18, 18, 18, 18, 21, 22, 24, 24, 24, 25, 27, 30, 33,
           33, 34, 34, 35, 38, 40, 40, 40, 40, 43, 44, 45, 46])




```python
i = np.argsort(x)
i
```




    array([ 9, 20, 11, 14,  8,  0, 29,  2, 25, 28, 23, 21, 18, 26,  1, 22, 24,
           19, 27, 17, 15,  3, 16,  7,  5,  6,  4, 10, 12, 13], dtype=int64)




```python
x[i]
```




    array([11, 13, 13, 16, 18, 18, 18, 18, 21, 22, 24, 24, 24, 25, 27, 30, 33,
           33, 34, 34, 35, 38, 40, 40, 40, 40, 43, 44, 45, 46])
